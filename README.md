## Examining the Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic Response on the Work of Archivists and LIS Professionals 

### Current Status

The survey is now closed. Thank you to all who participated--we appreciate your responses. 

### Initial Project Description

This project will focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work and careers of information professionals, specifically archivists and academic librarians. Research in the immediate aftermath of COVID has primarily focused on the pandemicâ€™s effect on institutions, rather than individuals. The primary research question aims to investigate the relationship between pre-existing archives and library labor issues and COVID-era changes. Has the pandemic amplified challenges that LIS professionals were already facing in their individual careers? Such changes might be evidenced by frequently-evolving job descriptions, funding issues, and a lack of professional development and capacity building opportunities. Some of the initial research questions include:

- Are professionals still in their pre-COVID positions, or did they get laid off, switch jobs, or take on different duties within the same institution? 
- Was work left unfinished when the March 2020 shutdown occurred, what was it, and has it resumed now in 2021?
- Have work and labor practices changed in the COVID era and how? For example, is there an increased reliance on unpaid labor?
- How have professional development, capacity building, networking, and funding been affected by COVID-era changes?

The intended outcome of this project is a projection of what the professional landscape might look like in the future if COVID-era changes to professional activities and work duties persist post-pandemic. One goal is to highlight how exceptional circumstances might bring about opportunities to advocate for LIS professionals and for profession-wide changes.
